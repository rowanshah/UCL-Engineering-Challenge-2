 Working in inter-disciplinary teams to design and prototype certain technical aspects of a new Tuberculosis (TB) vaccine production facility in Uganda, Sub-Saharan Africa

Global Health: Challenge 2
The Challenge:

Your task will be to work in inter-disciplinary teams to design and prototype certain technical aspects of a new Tuberculosis (TB) vaccine production facility in Uganda, Sub-Saharan Africa.  

You will work most closely with one other discipline in specialist teams consisting of:

Biochemical Engineers, Chemical Engineers and Biomedical Engineers 
Civil Engineers and Mechanical Engineers
Electrical Engineers and Computer Scientists
The technical design work will take the majority of your time, but you will also be asked to consider the sustainability and human aspects of the context in which your engineering designs are required.

Your brief - New vaccine for Tuberculosis
The disease tuberculosis is caused by bacterial infection of the lungs by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is transmissible by coughing, which creates airborne droplets that infect the lungs. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is a slow growing bacterium and once infection occurs it can lay dormant for many years.  It is estimated that one third of the world's population is infected with a form of TB.

According to the World Health Organisation (2017) there were 1.6 million deaths from TB in 2016, a rate which equates to one TB death every ten seconds.  Millions of people are diagnosed and treated successfully each year and 10.4 million people fell ill with TB in the same year, but there are still large gaps in detection and treatment.  In 2016, 6.3 million new cases of TB were reported, but this is only 61% of the estimated incidence of 10.4 million.  

A vaccine is available to combat TB. This is the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine. However, it has variable efficacy, ranging from 0-80% efficacy based upon geographic location, sub-type and strain variations [2,3]. Furthermore, new forms of drug resistant TB pose a significant new health challenge, especially for children who are considered a high-risk category [4,5]. As a consequence, research into treatment of TB has taken two forms.  The first is the development of new drugs and antibodies to fight the disease, but the real hope lies on the second strategy – to develop a new vaccine against TB. 

Design Remit
Currently the World Health Organisation in collaboration with partners in third, public and private sectors around the world, is driving a campaign to design and produce novel vaccines for the prevention and treatment of TB around the world.  Part of this campaign involves building capacity for vaccine manufacture in African countries, in order to secure a reliable, affordable supply of vaccines that meets local needs.  These production facilities will need to be self-sufficient and use local resources where possible.

Several research groups are investigating potential new vaccines and 15 different vaccines have already entered or are about to enter human trials [6].

It is your role as part of a multi-disciplinary Integrated Engineering (IE) Team to provide design recommendations on the possibility for  a TB vaccine facility in Uganda.  You will do this by designing and testing small scale systems or prototypes of your specialist elements of a vaccine manufacturing plant.   You will also be asked to advise on cultural acceptability, risk and security, ethics and sustainability of the real-world project.

Each IE Team will be made up of three specialist teams that work on:

(a) power provision for the plant (ME/CEGE)

(b) reactor and instrumentation design for the bioreactor  (BE/CE/BM) 

(c) reactor control systems to ensure the consistency of production (EEE/CS)

(d) security of vaccine supply chain (SCS Teams 1-5 only)
